# Advanced Text Adventure Paint Simulator  
This game was based from a traditional Text Adventure Game to a more advanced paint simulator, for example: in this game I have implemented a menu that you can move up and down with the arrow keys, implemented multiple scenes, added methods such as picking up an item and using it to unlock other scenes and proceed through the game.
